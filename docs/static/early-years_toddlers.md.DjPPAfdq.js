I like these more than videos for some reason.</p><p>Record voices as you put them to bed. The stories and conversations are so fun sometimes.</p><p>Say yes as much as you can. It&#39;s tempting to say no instinctively because it&#39;s something you yourself wouldn&#39;t do. Say yes to their weirdness and making messes, and especially when they invite you to play.</p><p>Apologizing to your child teaches them that everyone makes mistakes and that it&#39;s important to take responsibility for one&#39;s actions.</p><p>Children become who they need to be to get the love they seek.</p><p>A rushed child is an anxious child. Slow down with them if you can.</p><p>Speak to them like you would an adult. Just enunciate and speak a tad slower. They pick up a good vocabulary quickly.</p><p>Use appropriate body terms. &quot;I need to help you wipe your vulva,&quot; or &quot;Some parts of my body are sensitive when you hit them, like my neck/throat, my penis, and my face.&quot;</p><h2 id="play" tabindex="-1">Play <a class="header-anchor" href="#play" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Play&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Read to them often.</li><li>They just want to spend time with you.</li><li>Always wear sunscreen.</li></ul><p><strong>Interesting</strong>: I&#39;ve noticed that you anthropomorphize anything, it&#39;s always a male. I never interacted with girls in imaginary play EVER growing up as a boy. I&#39;ve noticed I have to make a conscious effort to make things girls in imaginary play.</p><ul><li>&quot;Oh you found a rolly polly? <em>He&#39;s</em> so cute! What&#39;s <em>his</em> name?&quot;</li><li>10 little monkeys jumping on the bed, one fell off and bumped <em>his</em> head.</li><li>&quot;Open wide!

But mistakes require teaching. e.g. &quot;I see you colored on the wall. That is a beautiful drawing, but never do that again. We only color on paper.&quot;</p><p>Kids literally don&#39;t know anything unless we teach them.</p><h3 id="defiance" tabindex="-1">Defiance <a class="header-anchor" href="#defiance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Defiance&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The opposite of <strong>defiance</strong> is not <strong>compliance</strong>. Both of those are a power struggle.</p><p>If your child is defiant, they are in power. If they are compliant, you are in power.</p><blockquote><p>The true opposite of <strong>defiance</strong> is <strong>connection</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>They are wanting to connect with you. &quot;Why don&#39;t you want to put on your shoes? Do your feet hurt? Is there something in them? You&#39;re not wanting to go because you want to stay home with us? Because you are nervous around new kids?&quot;</p><p>They could be trying to tell you so many things with their defiance. Our job is to try to gain understanding.</p><p>This is hard.</p><h3 id="time-outs" tabindex="-1">Time Outs <a class="header-anchor" href="#time-outs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Time Outs&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Time out is not a punishment</strong>. It&#39;s necessary. Everyone needs time outs. Mom and dad need time outs to cool down and regroup. Time outs are a good thing. Framing it this way has worked wonders for us. Good rule of thumb is about 1 minute for every year old they are.</p><p>With time outs, &quot;Go to your room until you&#39;re ready to act right&quot; communicates &quot;you&#39;re not accepted in this family with your big feelings&quot;. They need to learn emotional regulation, so you have to teach them during time outs. Give them words to their feelings and validate their experience. e.g. <em>&quot;You were upset because you wanted to set the table? But we did it for you. That was hard. I can&#39;t let you hit me when you&#39;re upset. What else can we do with the mad that&#39;s inside of you?&quot;</em></p><h3 id="etc" tabindex="-1">Etc <a class="header-anchor" href="#etc" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Etc&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If they refuse to eat, wait 15 minutes before giving them something else. That way they don&#39;t learn to refuse dinner to get the food <em>they</em> want.</p><p>Children aren&#39;t things to be molded but people to be unfolded. Over 200 traits are inherited from both parents. Try new things with them to help uncover what they love.</p><h2 id="stuff" tabindex="-1">Stuff <a class="header-anchor" href="#stuff" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stuff&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Silicone dishes are not dishwasher safe.
