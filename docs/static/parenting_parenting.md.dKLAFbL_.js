I promise it&#39;s worth it.</p><p>Put down your phone. Being fully present and making a memory is almost always better than the video you&#39;re going to take.</p><p>Dance often. Put you phone down except for pictures and videos.</p><p>Give them special 1-on-1 time with each parent. I prefer smoothie dates and library trips.</p><h2 id="teaching-them" tabindex="-1">Teaching them <a class="header-anchor" href="#teaching-them" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Teaching them&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Kids learn by observation and by play. Wonder aloud about things to inspire curiosity.</p><p>Ask them things like “how many plates do we need for dinner?” “We have 6 cookies, how many do we each get?”</p><p>Color- seriously- it develops the muscles needed for writing. Use scissors and play doh.</p><p>Stick to consequences! Teach them they can&#39;t always get their way. Teach them to name their feelings. Teach them to use words when they get upset, no hitting, etc. At 2.5 Aurora says &quot;I&#39;m frustrated at [thing]&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m just sad right now.&quot;</p><p>Teach them patience in small doses (waiting at the grocery store for example, or even on a longer car ride....don&#39;t just give them your phone to pass the time).</p><p>Have them do independent tasks ask much as possible, like take their plate to the kitchen after dinner. Teach them how to follow 1 or 2 step directions. (Go upstairs, get your socks, etc) Make them independent in all the ways you can, such as getting dressed, going to the bathroom, opening and closing lunch snack boxes and food packages omg. Teach them how to ask for help if they do need help with any of these tasks!</p><h3 id="reading" tabindex="-1">Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reading&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Read, read, read! Do things with them. Talk about what you are doing and why/how you are doing it.</p><p>Make reading a question game and use it to explore different ideas and perspectives. Yes its a kids book but you can still find character motivation and conflict.</p><ul><li>How does that character feel?</li><li>Why did this character act like that?</li><li>Why is that joke so funny?</li><li>How do you know she&#39;s sad?</li></ul><p><strong>ChatGPT or AI</strong> You can create a story together AND sprinkle in a lesson. For example, Aurora was a bit scared of a moth, so I said to ChatGPT &quot;Write me a story for a 2.5 year old girl about a moth who loved to gather pollen and how a little girl was afraid of the moth but shouldn&#39;t be&quot;. Or &quot;Write me a story for a toddler about two unicorn sisters named emery and aurora and how the older sister Aurora should be kind to the younger unicorn and not hit or say mean things&quot;. Seriously, amazing stories.</p>',18),r=[i];function s(h,d,l,p,c,u){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const y=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
