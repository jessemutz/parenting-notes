It&#39;s <em>not</em> helicopter parenting It&#39;s just meeting their needs. Everyone I know that follows this has AMAZING kids and a great relationship with them. It&#39;s very intuitive.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Book-Revised-Everything-Parenting/dp/0316198269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Baby book</a>. The thesis is that your baby cries because it has a need. You meeting that need develops trust and a loving bond that you&#39;re there for them.</p><blockquote><p>When they&#39;re an infant, savor the times they fall asleep on your chest. It will only happen like a dozen or two times in their life.</p></blockquote><h2 id="learn-the-5-s-s-to-soothe-baby" tabindex="-1">Learn the 5 S&#39;s to soothe baby <a class="header-anchor" href="#learn-the-5-s-s-to-soothe-baby" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Learn the 5 S&#39;s to soothe baby&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>Swaddle (the tighter the better)</li><li>Shush (louder than you think)</li><li>Side/stomach</li><li>Shake (light wiggles)</li><li>Suck</li></ol><p>If they&#39;re fed and changed, these work 95% of the time.</p><h2 id="learn-the-types-of-cries" tabindex="-1">Learn the types of cries <a class="header-anchor" href="#learn-the-types-of-cries" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Learn the types of cries&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><strong>Nyeh</strong> or <strong>neh</strong> - I am hungry.</li><li><strong>Heh</strong> - I am tired or uncomfortable</li><li>A <strong>grungy eh</strong> - I need to burp.</li><li>A <strong>owh</strong> means tired.</li></ol><p>Other cries may be &quot;I&#39;m bored.&quot; Starts with cooing to get your attention then it switches to fussy.</p><p>If prolonged colicky cries and nothing is working, you <em>will</em> get super frustrated.

Totally helps!</p><h2 id="clothing" tabindex="-1">Clothing <a class="header-anchor" href="#clothing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Clothing&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Avoid snaps at all costs. Zippers for life.</li><li>Huggies wipes are the only ones that you can grab a single wipe with one hand. All other brands make me feel genuine rage.</li><li>Huggies diapers suck in our experience. Blowouts all the time.</li><li>Diaper brand doesn&#39;t matter really. Go inexpensive.</li><li>Fold back of diapers down inside to avoid blowouts.</li><li>Don&#39;t get too many newborn cute outfits. They&#39;ll be in onesies almost exclusively.</li></ul><h2 id="other-tips" tabindex="-1">Other Tips <a class="header-anchor" href="#other-tips" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Other Tips&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Skin to skin for the win. Use touch as often as possible. While playing, holding, nursing, etc. Scratch head, rub arms and legs.</p><p>Infant stage: Mom nourishes baby. Dad nourishes mom.</p><p>You really don&#39;t need too much stuff, like medicines, swings, baby toys, or just stuff. We bought a ton of baby medicines just and case and never used it. If they&#39;re sick, get it that day. Otherwise youll throw it away in a year.</p><p>Also, check dosages. Baby medicine is expensive. The kid medicine is cheaper and the exact same, just convert the dose.</p><p>These are the only things you actually <em>need</em> on hand:</p><ul><li>Infant: Gas plugs (frida baby Windi)</li><li>saline and tiny bulb strings for dry nose and boogies</li><li>Electric nail file (baby elosh)</li><li>Nursing tops</li><li>Hakaa silicone pump</li><li>Check if your insurance will reimburse for a pump. If so, travel Madela pump.</li><li>I like baby K&#39;tan carrier, or some carrier that has a waist/hip support so your shoulders aren&#39;t carrying the weight.</li><li>Bottle brand doesn&#39;t really matter, just get all the same brand so parts are interchangeable.</li></ul><p>We love the pack and play with removable bassinet and changing table. That is crib in master bed for first 6 months. We only really used the crib for an occational nap during the first 6 months.</p><p>Take everything from the hospital. Diapers. Hats. Blankets. You paid for it.</p><p>Keep empty bins with age labels in their room. As they grow out of clothes (and the grow out QUICK), put them in the bins. Otherwise you&#39;ll have a mountain of random baby clothes you&#39;ll have to organize later and it sucks.</p><p>Kids learn by playing. That includes eating new foods. Let them make a mess. Point out the colors, shapes, and textures to them.</p><p>Speak in full sentences. Don&#39;t do baby voice, but enunciate clearly. They&#39;ll pick it up quick.</p>',25),s=[n];function r(l,h,u,d,p,c){return a(),t("div",null,s)}const f=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
