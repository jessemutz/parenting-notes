But mistakes require teaching. e.g. &quot;I see you colored on the wall. That is a beautiful drawing, but never do that again. We only color on paper.&quot;</p><p>Kids literally don&#39;t know anything unless we teach them.</p><h2 id="defiance" tabindex="-1">Defiance <a class="header-anchor" href="#defiance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Defiance&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The opposite of <strong>defiance</strong> is not <strong>compliance</strong>.

It&#39;s necessary. Everyone needs time outs. Mom and dad need time outs to cool down and regroup. Time outs are a good thing. Framing it this way has worked wonders for us. Good rule of thumb is about 1 minute for every year old they are.</p><p>With time outs, &quot;Go to your room until you&#39;re ready to act right&quot; communicates &quot;you&#39;re not accepted in this family with your big feelings&quot;. They need to learn emotional regulation, so you have to teach them during time outs. Give them words to their feelings and validate their experience. e.g. <em>&quot;You were upset because you wanted to set the table? But we did it for you. That was hard. I can&#39;t let you hit me when you&#39;re upset. What else can we do with the mad that&#39;s inside of you?&quot;</em></p>',15),s=[a];function r(u,h,l,d,c,p){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const y=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
