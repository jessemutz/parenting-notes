# Future notes for daughters
These are good quotes and thoughts I've had as a dad for when my girls are older.

## Identity
### Sooner or later you will get caught being yourself. Lead with who you really are.

Don't try to be who other people want you to be. Don't become someone you aren't to get them to like you. It's much easier to always be true to yourself and let people like that version of you.

### You are not obligated to look pretty.

Not when you're laying around the house.
Not when you go to the grocery store.
Not when you sit in a classroom.
Not when you go to the gym.
You are never obligated to dress up just so you are pretty for others.
**Pretty is not the rent you pay to exist in the world as a woman.**
