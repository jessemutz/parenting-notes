# Future notes for daughters
These are good quotes and thoughts I've had as a dad for when my girls are older.

### You are not obligated to look pretty.
Not when you're laying around the house.
Not when you go to the grocery store.
Not when you sit in a classroom.
Not when you go to the gym.
You are never obligated to dress up just so you are pretty for others.
**Pretty is not the rent you pay to exist in the world as a woman.**
