# Toddlers
Record their little voices when they say cute things. I like these more than videos for some reason.

Record voices as you put them to bed. The stories and conversations are so fun sometimes.

Say yes as much as you can. It's tempting to say no instinctively because it's something you yourself wouldn't do. Say yes to their weirdness and making messes, and especially when they invite you to play.

Apologizing to your child teaches them that everyone makes mistakes and that it's important to take responsibility for one's actions.

Children become who they need to be to get the love they seek.

A rushed child is an anxious child. Slow down with them if you can.

Speak to them like you would an adult. Just enunciate and speak a tad slower. They pick up a good vocabulary quickly.

Use appropriate body terms. "I need to help you wipe your vulva," or "Some parts of my body are sensitive when you hit them, like my neck/throat, my penis, and my face."

### Play
- Read to them often.
- They just want to spend time with you.
- Always wear sunscreen.

**Interesting**: I've noticed that you anthropomorphize anything, it's always a male. I never interacted with girls in imaginary play EVER growing up as a boy. I've noticed I have to make a conscious effort to make things girls in imaginary play.
- "Oh you found a rolly polly? *He's* so cute! What's *his* name?"
- 10 little monkeys jumping on the bed, one fell off and bumped *his* head.
- "Open wide! Here comes Mr. Spoon"

Try making things girls as well.

### Discipline

**Time out is not a punishment**. It's necessary. Everyone needs time outs. Mom and dad need time outs to cool down and regroup. Time outs are a good thing. Framing it this way has worked wonders for us. Good rule of thumb is about 1 minute for every year old they are.

With time outs, "Go to your room until you're ready to act right" communicates "you're not accepted in this family with your big feelings". They need to learn emotional regulation, so you have to teach them during time outs. Give them words to their feelings and validate their experience. e.g. *"You were upset because you wanted to set the table? But we did it for you. That was hard. I can't let you hit me when you're upset. What else can we do with the mad that's inside of you?"*

If they refuse to eat, wait 15 minutes before giving them something else. That way they don't learn to refuse dinner to get the food *they* want.

Children aren't things to be molded but people to be unfolded. Over 200 traits are inherited from both parents. Try new things with them to help uncover what they love.

### Stuff
- Silicone dishes are not dishwasher safe. They smell like soap and make food taste like soap.
- If they have a favorite stuffed animal, buy a second one to keep.
