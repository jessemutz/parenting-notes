# Infant & Baby Stuff
We like the concept of **Attachment parenting**. It's *not* helicopter parenting It's just meeting their needs. Everyone I know that follows this has AMAZING kids and a great relationship with them. It's very intuitive.

Check out the [Baby book](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Book-Revised-Everything-Parenting/dp/0316198269). The thesis is that your baby cries because it has a need. You meeting that need develops trust and a loving bond that you're there for them.

> When they're an infant, savor the times they fall asleep on your chest. It will only happen like a dozen or two times in their life.

## Learn the 5 S's to soothe baby  
1. Swaddle (the tighter the better)
2. Shush (louder than you think)
3. Side/stomach
4. Shake (light wiggles)
5. Suck

If they're fed and changed, these work 95% of the time.

## Learn the types of cries

1. **Nyeh** or **neh** - I am hungry.
2. **Heh** - I am tired or uncomfortable
3. A **grungy eh** - I need to burp.
4. A **owh** means tired.

Other cries may be "I'm bored." Starts with cooing to get your attention then it switches to fussy.

If prolonged colicky cries and nothing is working, you *will* get super frustrated. Grab noise cancelling headphones and fun, upbeat music like Jack Johnson or Jonas Brothers. Totally helps!

## Clothing
- Avoid snaps at all costs. Zippers for life.
- Huggies wipes are the only ones that you can grab a single wipe with one hand. All other brands make me feel genuine rage.
- Huggies diapers suck in our experience. Blowouts all the time.
- Diaper brand doesn't matter really. Go inexpensive.
- Fold back of diapers down inside to avoid blowouts.
- Don't get too many newborn cute outfits. They'll be in onesies almost exclusively.

## Other Tips
Skin to skin for the win. Use touch as often as possible. While playing, holding, nursing, etc. Scratch head, rub arms and legs.

Infant stage: Mom nourishes baby. Dad nourishes mom.

You really don't need too much stuff, like medicines, swings, baby toys, or just stuff. We bought a ton of baby medicines just and case and never used it. If they're sick, get it that day. Otherwise youll throw it away in a year.

Also, check dosages. Baby medicine is expensive. The kid medicine is cheaper and the exact same, just convert the dose.

These are the only things you actually *need* on hand:
- Infant: Gas plugs (frida baby Windi)
- saline and tiny bulb strings for dry nose and boogies
- Electric nail file (baby elosh)
- Nursing tops
- Hakaa silicone pump
- Check if your insurance will reimburse for a pump. If so, travel Madela pump.
- I like baby K'tan carrier, or some carrier that has a waist/hip support so your shoulders aren't carrying the weight.
- Bottle brand doesn't really matter, just get all the same brand so parts are interchangeable. 

We love the pack and play with removable bassinet and changing table. That is crib in master bed for first 6 months. We only really used the crib for an occational nap during the first 6 months.

Take everything from the hospital. Diapers. Hats. Blankets. You paid for it.

Keep empty bins with age labels in their room. As they grow out of clothes (and the grow out QUICK), put them in the bins. Otherwise you'll have a mountain of random baby clothes you'll have to organize later and it sucks.

Kids learn by playing. That includes eating new foods. Let them make a mess. Point out the colors, shapes, and textures to them.

Speak in full sentences. Don't do baby voice, but enunciate clearly. They'll pick it up quick.
