The second baby is pretty easy. You remember just about everything except swaddling.

Learning everyone's roles is the only tough part.

## Prepping for new baby

The best things we did to help was to make sure Aurora knows her role - which is a promotion to big sister - and give her little jobs like giving us the diapers and wipes for changing.

The other thing that helped her was to say "no" to the baby in front of her. Aurora hears "not right now I have to feed/hold baby" ALL the time, so it meant a lot to say "okay Emery I'm going to set you down so I can hold aurora" or "sorry Emery, i know you're crying but I'm helping your sister." Emery doesn't care but i can tell it means a lot to Aurora.


## Two toddlers

The older one will continue to struggle to know their role and get frustrated easily at the younger one. It's tough.

Using the language "superhero big sister" has helped. For example:

- What do superhero big sisters do? Do they hit? No of course not. Superhero big sisters protect their little sisters.
