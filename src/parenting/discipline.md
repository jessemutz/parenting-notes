# Discipline

> We don't discipline for mistakes, only rebellion.

Mistakes are things like coloring on the walls, spilling things, hurting sibling due to negligence or not paying attention.

Mistakes and rebellion both need connection and correction. But mistakes require teaching. e.g. "I see you colored on the wall. That is a beautiful drawing, but never do that again. We only color on paper."

Kids literally don't know anything unless we teach them.

## Defiance

The opposite of **defiance** is not **compliance**. Both of those are a power struggle.

If your child is defiant, they are in power. If they are compliant, you are in power.

> The true opposite of **defiance** is **connection**.

They are wanting to connect with you. "Why don't you want to put on your shoes? Do your feet hurt? Is there something in them? You're not wanting to go because you want to stay home with us? Because you are nervous around new kids?"

They could be trying to tell you so many things with their defiance. Our job is to try to gain understanding.

This is hard.

## Time Outs

**Time out is not a punishment**. It's necessary. Everyone needs time outs. Mom and dad need time outs to cool down and regroup. Time outs are a good thing. Framing it this way has worked wonders for us. Good rule of thumb is about 1 minute for every year old they are.

With time outs, "Go to your room until you're ready to act right" communicates "you're not accepted in this family with your big feelings". They need to learn emotional regulation, so you have to teach them during time outs. Give them words to their feelings and validate their experience. e.g. _"You were upset because you wanted to set the table? But we did it for you. That was hard. I can't let you hit me when you're upset. What else can we do with the mad that's inside of you?"_
